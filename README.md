	- **SmartStat_Updater_v4.bat** ( [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wTlqznBfgwOoerFaksASW_oBLRVoPKQO/view?usp=drive_link) ) <<< might be best
2. **Double-Click** the SmartStat_Updater_v4 (.bat)
	- A terminal window will load on screen giving you the status of the updater.
	- When it is finished (only a few seconds) you should see:
